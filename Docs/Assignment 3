Our group chose to use Javascript, NodeJS, ExpressJS and HandlebarJS. We will also be using mongoDB in the backend. We chose Node 
specifically because we thought thatit was useful that node is both a server side and client side language meaning it will be easy 
to transport data between the server and client side. ExpressJS is built to be highly compatible with NodeJS so it was the obvious 
choice to pair with NodeJS once we decided on it. We then decided to use handlebar to help with front end views and templating 
because it a clean language and it is compiled rather than interpreted. We briefly considered using python, flask, and mySQL because
a few group members had experience using it, however, we ultimately decided against it because we would like to get experience 
using different technology stacks.
